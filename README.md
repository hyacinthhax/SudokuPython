# SudokuPython
This is a Sudoku game that I'm working on. I'm adding different features and possibly a self solver soon. 
I'm mainly following A Plus Coding, a youtuber that really knows how to code, While filling in parts to fit my needs from other ideas over time.

To Start type:

python main.py

I am still adding to this program and modifying as well.
